            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas ſeveral Complaints have been made unto His Highneſs, That great quantities of Woolls, Wool-fels, and Fullers-Earth, are daily tranſported out of the Dominions of this Commonwealth into the Parts beyond the Seas, notwithſtanding the many good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws and Statutes heretofore made and provided (and yet it force) againſt the ſame, to the great inhauncing of the Rates and Prices of thoſe Commodities, and the apparent hurt, detriment and prejudice of the State: And His Highneſs having taken the ſame into due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and (with the advice of His Council) weighing the evil conſequences thereof, both to the Manufactures of this Nation; And alſo conſidering the prejudice that may happen to the Commonwealth in general, if ſome timely courſe be not taken for preventing the ſame: And whereas by ſeveral Acts, Statutes and Ordinances heretofore made, the tranſporting the ſame is prohibited under ſundry great and ſevere penalties; and to the intent none may pretend ignorance of the ſame, as alſo to quicken His Highneſs Officers and Miniſters, and others, to whom the excution of thoſe Laws, ſo advantagious and neceſſary to the Publique, is intruſted, to do their duties therein, His Highneſs (by and with the advice of His Council) hath thought fit to publiſh this His Proclamation, letting all the People of this Commonwealth know, That His Highneſs ſhall expect and require a due and exact obedience to the Laws in that behalf made: And His Highneſs likewiſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies His pleaſure, That he intends a full and effectual proſecution againſt all offenders and tranſgreſſors againſt the ſaid Laws, and that the utmoſt rigour and extremity thereof ſhall be required, without any hope of mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or moderation: And if any extremity ſhall happen to any one therein, his Highneſs ſhall account it Iuſtice,
<pb facs="tcp:154137:2"/>having diſcharged His duty in giving notice. And yet for a further manifeſtation of His care, hath thought fit to publiſh the effect of the laſt Law made for ſuppreſſing the ſame; <hi>(viz.)</hi> That by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, publiſhed the Nineteenth day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year our Lord, One thouſand ſix hundred forty ſeven, It is Ordained, That it ſhall not be lawful for any perſon or perſons, to lade, ſhip, or carry in any Ship, Barge, Boat, or other Veſſel, or otherwiſe, any Wooll of the growth of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any Woollen Yarn, Woollen Flox, Wool-fell, Fullers Earth, Clay, Tobacco-pipe-Clay, or any other Earth or Clay which may be uſed in the Art of Fulling, of intent to tranſport or carry the ſame into any place or places of the parts beyond the Seas, or into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Land or by Sea, or to carry the ſame to any Ship or other Veſſel whatſoever to be tranſported, upon the pain of the forfeiture of the ſaid Woolls, Woollen-yarn, Woollen Flox, Wool-fell, and Earth or Clay ſo laden, ſhipped, carried or tranſported, and three ſhillings for every pound of ſuch Wooll, Yarn, Flox, and Earth or Clay; And for every pound-weight of the ſaid Earth or Clay three ſhillings, to be forfeited by the owner or owners thereof; and alſo the owner of the ſaid ſhips or veſſels, knowing of ſuch offence, to forfeit all their intereſt in the ſaid ſhips or veſſels, with all their apparel and furniture to them and every of them belonging; and the Maſter and Mariners, knowing of ſuch offence, to forfeit all their Goods and Chattels, and to have Impriſonment by the ſpace of one whole year without Bayl or Mainprize. And it is by the ſaid Ordinance further Ordained, That if any Merchant, or any other perſon or perſons ſhould tranſport, or cauſe to be tranſported any of the ſaid Earth or Clay, Wooll, Woollen-yarn, or Woollen Flox, or Wool-fells, contrary to the intent of the ſaid Ordinance, That then he ſhould be diſabled for requiring any Debt or Accompt of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or others, for or concerning any Debt of Eſtate, properly belonging to ſuch Merchant and Offender, to his own uſe. And that if any owner of the land where ſuch Clay or Earth ſhould be digged or gotten, ſhould be privy unto, or know of ſuch Tranſportation by any perſon or perſons, and ſhould not diſcover the ſame to ſome Iuſtice or Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace, within three moneths of ſuch his knowledge, he ſhould for every ſuch offence forfeit Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of lawful Money of <hi>England:</hi> And that if ſuch Iuſtice of Peace to whom ſuch diſcovery ſhould be made, ſhould not certifie the ſame under his Hand and Seal to the Barons of the Exchequer, or one of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three Moneths following, he ſhould for every ſuch offence forfeit One hundred pounds of like lawful Money. Now to the intent tranſgreſſors may not be encouraged by the negligence of Officers and Courts of Iuſtice, His Highneſs (by and with the advice of his Council) doth Appoint, Authorize and Command, as well the Barons of the Exchequer, as the Attorney and Sollicitor-General, That they and every of them do ſpeedily and effectually put in execution the aforeſaid Ordinance of Parliament, and all and every other the Laws and Statutes made againſt tranſporting Woolls, Wool-fels, and Fullers-Earth; and that they and every of them do likewiſe in their ſeveral places effectually proſecute all and every ſuch perſon and perſons, whoſe Names have been already brought, or which ſhall hereafter be brought to them, or any of them, and who have offended, or that ſhall hereafter offend againſt the Law, in tranſporting Woolls, Wool-fels, and Fullers-Earth (in Our Courts of Iuſtice) and every ſuch perſon and perſons ſo offending, to puniſh according to their and every of their demerits, and according to the true intent and meaning of the ſeveral Statutes, Laws and Ordinances in that caſe made and provided, and of his Highneſs Pleaſure herein declared. And his Highneſs doth further (by and with the advice of his Council) Will and Require, and ſtraightly Charge and Command the Commiſſioners, and other Officers of the Cuſtoms in the ſeveral Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and in the Town and Port of <hi>Barwick,</hi> That they and every of them reſpectively in their ſeveral places, do take very good and ſufficient Security, That all Goods carried into <hi>Scotland,</hi> be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly delivered and landed at ſome Port there; and that authentique Certificates be thereof returned to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and other Officers of the Cuſtoms, within all and every the Ports in <hi>England,</hi> out of which the ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:154137:3"/>Goods were exported, before any Bonds be cancelled or delivered up by the Officers of the Cuſtoms within any of the ſaid Ports. And further, His Highneſs (by and with the advice of his Council) doth Will and Declare, That if ſuch Certificate and Certificates ſo to be returned in manner aforeſaid, be not returned within ſix Moneths next enſuing the time to be limited in every ſuch Bond, for the return thereof to the ſaid Commiſſioners and other Officers of the Cuſtoms in the ſeveral Ports in <hi>England,</hi> out of which the ſaid Goods were exported as aforeſaid; That then, and in all ſuch caſes, the ſaid Commiſſioners, and other Officers of the Cuſtoms within the ſeveral Ports of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe hands and cuſtodies ſuch Bonds ſhall be, at the expiration of the ſaid ſix Moneths, ſhall return, or cauſe to be returned the ſaid Bonds, and every of them, into the Court of Exchequer at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there to be proceeded upon accordingly.
